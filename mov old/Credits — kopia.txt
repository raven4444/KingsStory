{305}{355}Following Ludwig the Dreamer, | I was building my own Neuschwanstein,
{361}{420}hoping that my castle would be | more beautiful and masterfuk than the original.
{428}{500}Inspired by the unearthly music of Wagner, I walked | the mointain slopes, throught the fog, on goat paths,
{508}{560}step by step on narrow ledges above the chasms, and sometimes I stumbled and fell.
{586}{690}But I would rise again, supported by two thought. | First, because there are people who accomplisched even more
{700}{815}with only a dim hope to see their names engraved | on the Wall of Fame in the Hall of Glory. But i had a goal...
{825}{930}And second, I have to fulfil a promise. | The story of King the Dreamer is finished for me now.
{946}{1000}It's your turn.
